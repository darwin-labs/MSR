# Multi-Step Reasoning LLM Architecture

A framework to enhance the reasoning capabilities of foundation models through structured multi-step thinking processes.

## Overview

This project implements a Multi-Step Reasoning architecture designed to improve the problem-solving capabilities of base language models. By guiding models through explicit reasoning steps before generating final answers, we aim to reduce errors and enhance performance on complex tasks.

## Core Model

The architecture is built around **Qwen QWQ 32B**, leveraging its capabilities while adding structured reasoning components.

## Key Features

- **Explicit reasoning steps** that break down complex problems
- **Chain-of-thought prompting** integrated into the model architecture
- **Self-verification mechanisms** to catch and correct errors
- **Planning components** that encourage the model to outline solution steps before execution

## Use Cases

- Complex mathematical reasoning
- Multi-hop question answering
- Logical puzzles and deduction tasks
- Programming and algorithmic problem solving

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Core implementation of the multi-step reasoning architecture
- `models/`: Model configuration and adaptation for Qwen QWQ 32B
- `examples/`: Sample applications and demonstrations
- `eval/`: Evaluation frameworks and benchmarks
